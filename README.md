# Oldagram (Instagram Clone) solo project 

- This is my solution to a solo project in [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).
- This webpage is a simple clone of the Instagram interface, with some added functionalities such as:
    - Like posts
    - The number of likes for the posts gets updated on click and saved to the localStorage 
    - Like button icon change on click
    - Animated gradient background
    - Disable the right-click save on images, just like Instagram

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- My main missions for this project were as follows:
    1. Efficiently populate posts from the `posts` array of objects without extra HTML code:
        - Defined a template structure in my HTML and used it in the JavaScript code to populate the posts
        - Dynamically generated selectors with unique ids based on the number of posts. e.g. `this['likeBtn'+p.id] = document.querySelector('#like-btn-'+p.id);`
    2. Store the number of likes for the posts so they won't reset on page refresh
        - Benefited from localStorage to set key values for the number of likes and the liked state
    3. Implement a UI similar to Instagram's, plus:
        - Animated gradient background
        - `img { pointer-events: none; }`: Disable the right-click save on images, , just like Instagram
- I built this project from scratch and added more functionalities than what was asked. 
- Hope you like it! Feel free to suggest corrections to my code üôåüèº
