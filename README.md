Fun features:
- likes are saved and will not be cleared on refresh
- animated gradient background
- populate posts based on a template and an array of objects
    - dynamically generate unique id attributes for those posts 
- In CSS -> `img { pointer-events: none; }`: Disable the right-click save on images, , just like Instagram




# Oldagram (Instagram Clone) solo project 

- This is my solution to a solo project in [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).
- This webpage is a simple clone of the Instagram interface, with some added functionalities such as:
    - Like posts
    - The number of likes for the posts gets updated on click and saved to the localStorage 
    - Like button icon change on click
- My main missions for this project were as follows:
    1. Efficiently populate posts from the `posts` array of objects without extra HTML code:
        - Defined a template structure in my HTML and used it in the JavaScript code to populate the posts
        - Dynamically generated selectors with unique ids based on the number of posts. e.g. `this['likeBtn'+p.id] = document.querySelector('#like-btn-'+p.id);`
    2. Store the number of likes for the posts so they won't reset on page refresh
        - Benefited from localStorage to set key values for the number of likes and the liked state
    3. Implement a UI similar to Instagram's
        - Extra feature: Animated gradient background
- I built this project from scratch and added more functionalities than what was asked. 
- Hope you like it! Feel free to suggestion corrections and fixes to my code üôåüèº

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

The only difficult part of this challenge was adding responsiveness. 

I struggled to set the width of the columns to 100% on tablets and mobiles. 

During learning how to fix this, I learned about these definitions:
- `flex-grow`
- `flex-shrink`
- `flex-basis`
- `width: max-content`

Overall, I enjoyed my time working on this project. CSS can become quite challenging, but when learned the right way, any challenge can be tackled easily.
